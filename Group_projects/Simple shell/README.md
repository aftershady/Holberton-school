# **Simple Shell**

'A mini command interpreter.
- the story about the shell: [Ken Thompson](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Pzs_A3Wo6LTHE8WX_uKiWg), [Thompson shell](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/FLRzIA3zLln5XV7erPHgsQ), [Unix shell](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/McTQ6qvcqZZQlZtZdjdVnQ).
**- what is a shell?**

A shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system. It allows users to give commands to the computer and execute programs.

**Main Functions of a Shell:**
- Command Interpretation: The shell reads the commands entered by the user and interprets them.
- Command Execution: It runs the requested programs and displays their results.
- Process Management: The shell can create and manage processes to execute commands.
**Types of Shell:**
- Interactive Shell: Allows real-time interaction with the user (e.g., Bash, Zsh).
- Non-Interactive Shell: Executes commands automatically from script files (e.g., run through shell scripts).
**Example:**
- When you type ls in a terminal, the shell executes the command to display the files and directories in the current directory.
- In summary, a shell is like a translator between what you want to do and what the computer understands.

## Implemented Features
-  The shell displays a prompt and waits for user input.
- Command Execution: Commands entered by the user are executed using the execve system call.
- Error Management: If a command does not exist, an error message is displayed.
- End of File (EOF) Handling: The shell handles EOF (Ctrl+D) to exit interactive mode.
- Argument Processing: Commands can now include arguments.
- PATH Management: The shell searches for executables in directories specified by the PATH environment variable.
- Built-in Commands: Implementation of built-in commands such as exit to quit the shell and env to display environment variables.

## File Structure
- main.c: Entry point for the shell. Initializes the program and manages the main loop.
- shell.c: Contains core functions to read, parse, and execute commands.
- utils.c: Utility functions for command processing and PATH management.

## Compilation

The shell is compiled with the following options:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
Ensure that all files end with a newline and that the coding style conforms to Betty.
## Usage
### Interactive Mode

Launch the shell in interactive mode with:
```bash
  ./hsh
```
The prompt ($) will be displayed, and you can enter commands directly.

### Non-interactive mode
You can also execute commands in non-interactive mode using redirection:
~~~~bash
echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
~~~~
The shell will execute the ls command and display the results.

With this mini shell, you can run several types of commands:

### System Commands:
- Full Path Executables: You can execute commands by specifying the full path, e.g., `/bin/ls`, `/usr/bin/env`.

- Commands Using PATH: You can execute commands without specifying the full path, e.g., `ls`, `grep`, `cat`, as long as the executable is located in one of the directories specified in the `PATH` environment variable.
### Commands with Arguments:
- Single Command with Arguments:You can execute commands with additional arguments, `e.g`., `ls -l /tmp`, `grep 'pattern' filename`.
## Built-in Commands:
- `exit`: Exits the shell.
- `env`: Displays the current environment variables.
- `cd` [directory]: Changes the current working directory.
- `setenv VARIABLE VALUE`: Sets or updates an environment variable.
- `unsetenv VARIABLE`: Removes an environment variable.
- `help`: Provides help on built-in commands.
### Control Commands:
- EOF (Ctrl+D): Exits the shell in interactive mode.
### Error Handling:
- If a command cannot be found, it displays an appropriate error message.
- This shell mimics basic functionalities found in typical Unix shells, allowing you to execute standard Unix commands and manage your environment.

## Concept Explanation

### Process Creation
The shell uses `fork` to create a new process. The child process executes the command using `execve`, while the parent process waits for the child to complete using `wait`.

### PATH Management
The shell uses the PATH environment variable to locate executables. When a command is entered, the `shell` searches for the executable file in the directories listed in `PATH`.

### System Calls
System calls like `execve`, `fork`, and `wait` are used to execute programs, create processes, and manage their execution.

### Future Development
Redirection and Pipes: Implement advanced features such as output redirection and piping.
Environment Variable Support: Manage environment variables and allow modification from the shell.

### Known Bugs
Arguments passed at execution (ac/av) are not considered.
Multiple commands not supported in non-interactive mode.
when only spaces are given, you may have an invalid error message
