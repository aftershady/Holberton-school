# Python - Exceptions

This project focuses on understanding and using exceptions in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- The difference between errors and exceptions
- What exceptions are and how to use them
- When to use exceptions
- How to correctly handle an exception
- The purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise a builtin exception
- When to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Tasks

0. **Safe list printing**: Write a function that prints x elements of a list.
1. **Safe printing of an integers list**: Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
2. **Print and count integers**: Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
3. **Integers division with debug**: Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.
4. **Divide a list**: Write a function that divides element by element 2 lists.
5. **Raise exception**: Write a function that raises a type exception.
6. **Raise a message**: Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Resources

- [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
- [Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vbgD-3s-w4) (starting at minute 7)

This project will help you understand how to handle errors and exceptions in Python, improving the robustness of your code.
