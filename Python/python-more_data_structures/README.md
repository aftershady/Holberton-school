# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project explores advanced data structures in Python, particularly sets and dictionaries.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What sets are and how to use them
- Most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What dictionaries are and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What a key is in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What a lambda function is
- What map, reduce and filter functions are

## Tasks

0. **Squared simple**: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
1. **Search and replace**: Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
2. **Unique addition**: Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list.
3. **Present in both**: Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
4. **Only differents**: Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
5. **Number of keys**: Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
6. **Print sorted dictionary**: Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
7. **Update dictionary**: Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
8. **Simple delete by key**: Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
9. **Multiply by 2**: Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
10. **Best score**: Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
11. **Multiply by using map**: Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number using map.
12. **Roman to Integer**: Write a function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

## Requirements

- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using wc
