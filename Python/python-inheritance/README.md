# Python - Inheritance

This project explores the concept of inheritance in Python, focusing on how to create and use inherited classes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherit from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions

## Tasks

1. My list
2. Exact same object
3. Same class or inherit from
4. Only sub class of
5. Geometry module
6. Improve Geometry
7. Integer validator
8. Rectangle
9. Full rectangle
10. Square #1
11. Square #2

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a newline character
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- All test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have documentation
- All classes should have documentation
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation
