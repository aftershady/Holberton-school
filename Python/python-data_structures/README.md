Here's a README.md for the Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples project:

# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project focuses on understanding and working with lists and tuples in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What lists are and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Common methods of lists and their usage
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- List comprehensions and their usage
- What tuples are and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What sequences are
- Tuple packing and sequence unpacking
- The del statement and its usage

## Tasks

0. **Print a list of integers**: Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
1. **Secure access to an element in a list**: Write a function that retrieves an element from a list.
2. **Replace element**: Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.
3. **Print a list of integers... in reverse!**: Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
4. **Replace in a copy**: Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
5. **Can you C me now?**: Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
6. **Lists of lists = Matrix**: Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
7. **Tuples addition**: Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
8. **More returns!**: Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
9. **Find the max**: Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
10. **Only by 2**: Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
11. **Delete at**: Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
12. **Switch**: Complete the source code to switch value of a and b.
