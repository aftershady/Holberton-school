# Python - Test-driven development

This project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python, emphasizing the importance of writing tests before implementing functionality.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What's an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Tasks

0. **Integers addition**: Write a function that adds 2 integers.
1. **Divide a matrix**: Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.
2. **Say my name**: Write a function that prints "My name is <first name> <last name>".
3. **Print square**: Write a function that prints a square with the character #.
4. **Text indentation**: Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :.
5. **Max integer - Unittest**: Write unittests for the function `def max_integer(list=[]):`.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a newline character
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable

### Python Test Cases
- All test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have documentation
- All functions should have documentation

## Resources

- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unit-testing-python-unittest/)

This project will help you understand the importance of testing in software development and how to implement test-driven development in Python.
