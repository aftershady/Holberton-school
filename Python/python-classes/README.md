# Python - Classes and Objects

This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, introducing the concepts of classes and objects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is OOP
- "First-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- How to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- The special `__init__` method and how to use it
- Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- The difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
- How Python finds the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Tasks

0. My first square: Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square.
1. Square with size: Write a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.
2. Size validation: Add size validation to the `Square` class.
3. Area of a square: Add a public instance method to calculate the area of the square.
4. Access and update private attribute: Implement getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute.
5. Printing a square: Add a method to print the square using the `#` character.
6. Coordinates of a square: Add a `position` attribute to the `Square` class.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a newline character
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules, classes, and functions should have documentation
