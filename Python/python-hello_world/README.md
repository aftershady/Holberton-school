# Python - Hello, World

This project introduces the basics of Python programming, including printing text, variables, and string manipulation.

## Objectives

- Understand how to use the Python interpreter
- Learn to print text and variables using `print()`
- Explore strings in Python, including indexing and slicing
- Understand the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

## Exercises

1. **Hello, print**: Write a Python script that prints `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`.

2. **Print integer**: Complete a source code to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `"Battery street"`, followed by a new line.

3. **Print float**: Complete a source code to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

4. **Print string**: Complete a source code to print 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

5. **Play with strings**: Complete a source code to print `"Welcome to Holberton School!"`.

6. **Copy - Cut - Paste**: Complete a source code to manipulate the string stored in the variable `word`.

7. **Create a new sentence**: Complete a source code to print `"object-oriented programming with Python"`, followed by a new line.

8. **Easter Egg**: Write a Python script that prints `"The Zen of Python"`, by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
