# Python - More Classes and Objects

This project delves deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on advanced concepts related to classes and objects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP
- "First-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- What are the special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and how to use them
- What is the difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`
- What is a class attribute
- What is the difference between an object attribute and a class attribute
- What is a class method
- What is a static method
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is and what does contain `__dict__` of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Tasks

9. A square is a rectangle

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

- All files should end with a newline character
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`
